# Project Conventions

- Use TypeScript for all new files
- Prefer yarn over npm (no PnP; use node_modules)
- Use arrow functions instead of function declarations
- Prefer immutability and functional programming patterns
- Avoid classes; use functional patterns
- Use strict TypeScript configuration

## Code Style

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use single quotes for strings
- Add trailing commas in multiline objects/arrays
- Use `as const` where appropriate
- Prefer `interface` over `type` for object shapes
- Use meaningful variable and function names

## File Organization

- Use kebab-case for file names
- Group related files in folders
- Keep modules small and focused
- Separate business logic from presentation logic

## Import/Export

- Use named exports over default exports
- Group imports: external libraries, internal modules, relative imports
- Use absolute imports with path mapping when configured
